The goal of the wiki is to cover a wide range of topics related to game development.

When building a game engine from scratch, there are several valid approaches and there is no perfect way of doing things.

For a given topic, multiple strategies will be covered with their advantages and pitfalls.

The advantage of building a wiki instead of a blog is that the information can be better organized, and improved over time.
